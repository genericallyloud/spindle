        <h2>What the crap is Spindle? (aka Vaporware)</h2>

<p>The goal of Spindle is to provide a single language that is specialized for creating rich modern websites and applications. It is not meant to be used as a general purpose language, though seeing as rich modern web applications are quite broad in scope, it does have to have a good range.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>

<p>The challenges I see include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intelligently utilizing the range of web technologies available: html/css/js/http/new html5 apis</li>
<li>Providing a language that goes with the grain: it should feel <em>webby</em>
</li>
<li>Distributed computing: making it easy to work between client and server</li>
<li>No Threads: nor would I want them, but I would like my language to aid in the asynchrony common to javascript</li>
</ul><h2>Features</h2>

<p>After playing around with the challenges for a while, the approach that I'd like to start with has the following key features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Declarative/Functional: Should be able to express UI in a declarative style, and even have pattern matching elements that can be used in a similar fashion to CSS or XPath. This is pretty webby - look at XML,JSON,HTML,CSS</li>
<li>Structural typing, with simplified nominal elements (nominal pieces allowing for some of the benefits of enums and ADTs)</li>
<li>Type inference as much as possible to maintain a dynamic feel, but allow for stronger type guarantees for larger applications</li>
<li>OCap as a security model</li>
<li>Promises to handle asynchrony: Promises and OCap are some of the founding features of the E programming language and influential </li>
</ul>
